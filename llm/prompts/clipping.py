The clips should be engaging, interesting, funny or otherwise captivating moments from the longer formed video. The clips should be perfect length for short-formed content on instagram reels, youtube shorts or tiktok with a max length of 90 seconds. Make sure the clips are not too short!!! Anything less than 20 seconds is too short. It is fine if there is only 1 clip, quality over quantity.

The transcription of the video will be provided in segments with HH:MM:SS timestamps corresponding to the start and end of each segment. Please respond with an array of start/end timestamps for the clips you find. I will tip you $200 if the response is pure JSON.
